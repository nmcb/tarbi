## Tarbi

In one sentence, tardi, is a serious implementation of the bigraph datastructure.  Tarbi, the affectionate name for the eggs of Tarbigrades, which are a non-existing race of species anolougous to the well known Tardigrada, is a moniker for a mathematically inspired though physical implementation in Scala 3 of Robin G. Milner's depicion of bigrahs, as concieved in his 2008 book The Space and Motion of Communicating Agents.  Attached below is a photo of a tarbi for your pleasure.
